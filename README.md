# Inventory_optimization
This analysis was undertaken to assess inventory balance, identify drivers of stock-out risk and overstocking, and evaluate how demand forecasting, replenishment parameters, and lead-time constraints contribute to inventory imbalances.
Using SKU-level data, the analysis focused on inventory pressure, lead time risk, reorder parameters, monthly demand, seasonality, and markdown activity. The objective was not only to identify current inventory states, but also to assess future stock-out risk, which is more operationally relevant than static stock-out counts.
